Bismark report for: /scratch2/desenabr/paired_q0/SRR3897178_mm10_1.fq and /scratch2/desenabr/paired_q0/SRR3897178_mm10_2.fq (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /panfs/qcb-panasas/desenabr/ref_genomes/mm10/index/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --dovetail --minins 32 --maxins 3000
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	124995278
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	83312489
Mapping efficiency:	66.7% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	33369845
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	8312944
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	7

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	41822311	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	41490171	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
